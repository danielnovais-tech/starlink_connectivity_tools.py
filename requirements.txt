# Starlink Connectivity Tools Requirements
# 
# This is a minimal implementation for demonstration purposes.
# In a production environment, you would typically use:
# - starlink-grpc-core (for real Starlink gRPC API integration)
# - grpcio (for gRPC communication)
# - protobuf (for protocol buffers)
#
# For this example, no external dependencies are required.
