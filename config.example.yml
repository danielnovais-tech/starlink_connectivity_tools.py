# Starlink Monitor Configuration Example

# Monitoring interval (seconds)
check_interval: 60

# Logging configuration
log_file: starlink_connectivity.log
log_max_bytes: 10485760  # 10 MB
log_backup_count: 5

# Connectivity health thresholds
min_uptime_seconds: 300  # 5 minutes
max_ping_latency_ms: 100
max_ping_drop_rate: 0.05  # 5%
min_download_mbps: 50
min_upload_mbps: 5
max_obstruction_percentage: 5

# Automated action thresholds
consecutive_failures_before_reboot: 3

# Notes:
# - Adjust thresholds based on your specific requirements
# - In crisis scenarios, you may want to lower the min speeds
# - Consider increasing consecutive_failures_before_reboot to avoid unnecessary reboots
# - For areas with frequent obstructions (trees, buildings), increase max_obstruction_percentage
